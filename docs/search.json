I am a political economist, interested\r\n            in the politics of energy transitions and business lobbying\r\n            more broadly. In my Job Market\r\n            Paper I study how policymakers strategically design\r\n            climate policies to expand the political coalition in\r\n            support of the energy transition. I also study how\r\n            coalitional strategies shape informational lobbying, and how\r\n            family firms have an advantage in the use of campaign\r\n            contributions in developing countries. To address my\r\n            research questions, I use formal models, original data\r\n            collection, and causal inference methods.\r\n            I am on the job\r\n            market.
