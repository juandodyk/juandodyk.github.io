I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University. Starting in July 2025, I will join Washington University in St. Louis as an Assistant Professor in Political Science and Environmental Studies.

I am a political economist interested in climate policy and business lobbying. I study how policymakers strategically design climate policies to overcome opposition from carbon-intensive industries, how interest groups use tactical coalitions to increase their effectiveness in informational lobbying, and how family firms build political power in developing countries. To address my research questions, I use formal models, original data collection, and causal inference methods.

See my Job Market Paper, "Inefficient Policies in the Green Transition" [here](files/jmp.pdf), my [CV](files/cv.pdf), and my [research](research.html).
