I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University. I do research on lobbying and campaign contributions, both empirical and theoretical. I am interested in political economic theory more broadly.

See my [research](research.html), my [CV](files/cv.pdf), my [teaching slides](teaching.html), and my [old blog](blog.html).
